Random Quote Generator - Treehouse Full Stack TechDegree Project 1
__________________________________________________________________

GOAL: This was the first project assigned in the Treehouse (teamtreehouse.com) Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program. The requirements were to create a JavaScript program that printed a quote randomly generated from an array, of at least five, to the screen when the user hits a button. For extra credit, we were asked to:

1. Make sure the quotes did not repeat until each had been shown,
2. Randomly have the background change color when the quotes change, and
3. Have a default timer that changes the quote on its own, if the user hasn't hit the button.
